            <p>The International Day of Yoga is a day in recognition of Yoga, 
                that is celebrated across the world annually on June 21, 
                following its adoption by the United Nations in 2014.
            <p>
                Yoga, a transformative practice, represents the harmony of mind and body, 
                the balance between thought and action, and the unity of restraint and fulfillment. 
                It integrates the body, mind, spirit, and soul, offering a holistic approach to health and 
                well-being that brings peace to our hectic lives. 
                Its power to transform is what we celebrate on this special day.
            </p>
           
            On December 11, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly designated June 21 as the 
            International Day of Yoga. Since then, millions of people around the globe, united by the practice of yoga, have celebrated this day each year. This global celebration fosters unity and harmony, transcends borders and cultures, and brings us closer to a world of peace and well-being. Last year, the International Day of Yoga celebration at the United Nations Headquarters created a
             Guinness World Record for the participation of yoga enthusiasts of most nationalities.
